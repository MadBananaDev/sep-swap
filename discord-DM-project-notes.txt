[06:01 AM]
I'm meant to create 5 contracts right?
[06:01 AM]
yep 5

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:02 AM
yes, they can be simple. but they must have a different function or purpose. 

dont just put 5 duplicates 


then for the token contracts $MAD $MATE etc
Make sure they can read balances

BigTime — Today at 06:04 AM

BigTime — Today at 06:05 AM
okay

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:05 AM
create 5 new smart contracts 

and then for the 5 esiting token contracts, just include an interface to get the wallets balance that sends the txn from the html page

BigTime — Today at 06:12 AM
okay
[06:19 AM]
this thing is giving me problems to verify

BigTime — Today at 06:19 AM
i think i will pick random verified contracts on sepolia scan
[06:19 AM]
what do you think @MonkeyMike.eth ?

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:26 AM
just use  the ones we have then !!
[06:26 AM]
omg
[06:26 AM]
thats wat i did ... main catch up please
[06:27 AM]
i like it
[06:27 AM]
but put all the contracts function in not just a couple like we did the first time
[06:28 AM]
also make sure the tokens have all the functions there too, 
the point of this is to abstract away etherscan and create somthing the whole community can use to interact with chains

@MonkeyMike.eth
just use  the ones we have then !!

BigTime — Today at 06:28 AM
yup

@MonkeyMike.eth
$MAD https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x7b818ea33426b1324cbfbc0450600c0510c99748 $ BOOM https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x3a0b07e58b7b63ae10b9b89fd83fc413f6312b64 $ZOO https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x051df65d05e04062dbbd8dfb7f21752e2ca5449a $PEEL https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x541ad6c548ffe82779bcc35302435f5a0e30a8cc $JUNK https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x7389ddd79d8b22d1de5384c8fc8fa1ac80ac4532 $MATE https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0xa624b34aa8de364328d03e2b0e827ca9c51156e5

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:31 AM

BigTime

BigTime — Today at 06:31 AM

@BigTime

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:31 AM
so i just thought of a fix, we dont need them verified, just make a normal read qury to for the balance of an address of a token

BigTime — Today at 06:31 AM
okay

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:31 AM
we dont have to interact with the token contract itself for that

okay lemme do that

@BigTime
i uploaded the code on github

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:32 AM
okay makes these changes and then make sure its fully updated before i make my commits

BigTime — Today at 06:32 AM
so asically the code just checks for the balance of the user to see if they hold that token?
[06:32 AM]
*basically
[06:32 AM]
@MonkeyMike.eth

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:34 AM
initially yes, but we will add to that function block. 

make an option to get all token balances in one response if they want it. but each token should also have its invidualized button to just get that toien.

BigTime — Today at 06:34 AM
oh, okay

MonkeyMike.eth — Today at 06:35 AM
the wallet balance wwill be the balance of the msg.sender (person sending the contract call )( 

but we will have the ability to look at any wallets balance so mske a option for the variable parameters of which addresses are getting quried for balnace. 

most of the time its just the user getting their own blance

BigTime — Today at 06:40 AM
alright bud, onnit
